Guide to setting up Geth &amp; Prysm on Windows with autostart

This guide is currently a WIP. All attempts at staking are at your own risk.
I'm writing this mainly as an opportunity to learn and improve my own setup, but am happy to share my steps for anyone who can find them useful. 
Do not try to set up a node without understanding the steps and risk you are taking. I can not guarantee that these steps will work for you. 
Make sure you have read and understood all information @ https://launchpad.ethereum.org/

I strongly recommend that you learn on the tesnet before staking on mainnet. 

Thanks to /r/ethstaker for being a friendly & helpful community. 

This guide will curently not discuss topics that have been covered in detail elsewhere (hardware requirements etc.). I'm trying to focus on the steps that are specific for Windows and not commonly discussed.
